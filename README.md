# Team 11 Java Course Project

## Set-up

- ### BACKEND
  - We used a Java backend with MySQL DB.
  - To start up the backend service, please:
    - `Set-up a MySQL server locally`
    - `Import the repo as a Maven project into Eclipse`
    - `Modify application.properties file according to your MySQL server configs`
    - `Run as -> Spring Boot App`

- ### FRONTEND
  - We proudly support two frontends - **Spring Boot MVC** and **ReactJS**
  - For Spring Boot MVC:
    - It starts together with backend services. Visit localhost:8080/vi/login after the backend is booted to use it.
  - For ReactJS:
    - `cd /frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm run start`
